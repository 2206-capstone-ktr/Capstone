This program will eventually be deployed to Heroku, but currently can only be run locally.

## Local Setup

Create two databases:

```
createdb planr
createdb planr-test
```

Next, npm install and run the seed script in the terminal:

```
npm install
npm run seed
```

To run the program, open two terminal windows. Enter each line below into a different terminal window to run:

```
npm run start:dev
npm run build:css
